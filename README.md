Just learning how to start using Github in my everyday learning/practising process

Hello World!

I am a self-taught person with that target to be a Front-End Developer. I know HTML, CSS and recently I am working on JavaScript fundamentals which is my first programming language so you might imagine how I struggle at some points. I still know nothing about framewoks because I believe it is much better to start with the basics in order to understand why such framework acts in that way. 

I have much to learn and much more to practise but what is important that I don't give up for what I want.
